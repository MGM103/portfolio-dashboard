# Portfolio Dashboard TUI ðŸ“Š

### Description

Portfolio dashboard is a Terminal UI application for seeing the value of one's digital asset portfolio.

Currently each ecosystem has tools for ascertaining portfolio information and other data points. Therefore in the current landscape one must use a combination of tools to get a holistic valuation of a portfolio of digital assets. These tools are mostly web based applications that use various on-chain indexers to gather information and can feel quite laggy and slow to use. This makes the task of ascertaining portfolio details laborious, tedious and unpleasant.

Enter portfolio dashboard, this TUI runs locally and stores your data on your own device. It is quite simple in design, digital asset positions are added manually, the valuation of the portfolio is then able to be calculated in a moments notice. There is also a watchlist feature to monitor assets that are not yet owned.

Currently the data for digital asset pricing is sourced from [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).

## Acknowledgements

This project was built using [bubble tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI application framework, leveraging [bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) the component library.

Additionally, this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gzypL-Qv-g&t=1s) from [package main](https://www.youtube.com/@packagemain) was a great aid in learning how to structure and build the application.
